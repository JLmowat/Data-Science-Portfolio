## Weather predictions
This Python project is a weather prediction application that utilizes historical weather data obtained through web scraping. The project involves collecting historical weather data, cleaning and preprocessing it, and applying a Ridge Regression model to forecast the temperature for the next day.
Features

*    Web Scraping: The project uses web scraping techniques to fetch historical weather data.

*    Data Cleaning: The collected data is carefully cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies, ensuring high-quality data for model training.

*    Ridge Regression Model: The application leverages the Ridge Regression algorithm, a variant of linear regression, which helps prevent overfitting and improves prediction accuracy.

*    Temperature Prediction: With the Ridge Regression model trained on historical data, the project can predict the temperature for the next day based on various weather variables.
